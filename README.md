In this project, we aim to classify various physical activities based on the data provided in the attached file. This will involve analyzing different features such as duration, intensity, heart rate, and other relevant parameters that can distinguish between different types of physical activities. By applying machine learning techniques, we will build a model capable of accurately categorizing activities into distinct classes. The objective is to explore how various factors relate to different physical activities and to apply appropriate data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation methods to ensure high classification accuracy.
